The Inferentia chip delivers best-in-class ML inference performance at the lowest cost in cloud. Trainium will deliver the best-in-class ML training performance with the most teraflops (TFLOPS) of compute power for ML in the cloud. This is all enabled by cutting edge software stack, the AWS Neuron Software Development Kit (SDK), which includes an ML compiler, runtime and natively integrates into popular ML frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow and MxNet. AWS Neuron and Inferentia are used at scale with customers like Snap, Autodesk, Amazon Alexa, Amazon Rekognition and more customers in various other segments.

The Team: As a whole, the Amazon Annapurna Labs team is responsible for silicon development at AWS. The team covers multiple disciplines including silicon engineering, hardware design and verification, software and operations.

The AWS Neuron team works to optimize the performance of complex neural net models on our custom-built AWS hardware. More specifically, the AWS Neuron team is developing a deep learning compiler stack that takes neural network descriptions created in frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNET, and converts them into code suitable for execution. As you might expect, the team is comprised of some of the brightest minds in the engineering, research, and product communities, focused on the ambitious goal of creating a toolchain that will provide a quantum leap in performance.

You: As a Sr. Machine Learning Compiler Engineer III on the AWS Neuron team, you will be a thought leader supporting the ground-up development and scaling of a compiler to handle the world's largest ML workloads. Architecting and implementing business-critical features, publish cutting-edge research, and mentoring a brilliant team of experienced engineers excites and challenges you. You will leverage your technical communications skill as a hands-on partner to AWS ML services teams and you will be involved in pre-silicon design, bringing new products/features to market, and many other exciting projects. A background in Machine Learning and AI accelerators is preferred, but not required.

In order to be considered for this role, candidates must be currently located or willing to relocate to Cupertino (perferred), Seattle, Austin, or Toronto.

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.
We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.

Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.

This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.

Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.

We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.

Requirements:
Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.
Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.
Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.

We design, manufacture, and operate our own balloons, using the data they collect to generate otherwise unattainable weather intelligence.
Our mission is to eliminate weather uncertainty, and in the process help humanity adapt to climate change, be that predicting hurricanes or speeding the adoption of renewables. We are building a future in which the planet is instrumented by thousands of our micro high-altitude balloons, eliminating gaps in our understanding of the atmosphere and giving people and businesses the information they need to make critical decisions. The founding team of Stanford engineers was named Forbes 2019 30 under 30 and is backed by top investors including Khosla Ventures.
This role is unlike a typical machine learning position. You will begin as a regular member of our Deep Learning team, contributing to the development of our cutting-edge global AI weather model, WeatherMesh. After a few months, you will transition into a “forward-deployed” role, becoming the technical point of contact and project manager for key external collaborations, including a DARPA project. This means owning both the technical contributions and the customer relationship, ensuring WindBorne’s models are successfully integrated into high-stakes projects.
You won’t just be training models in isolation. You’ll be learning the science, building the systems, and then sitting across the table from program managers and partners, explaining how and why the model works—and what comes next. The person in this role will bridge worlds: the intensity of deep learning R&D and the practical realities of customer-facing relationships and delivery.
Responsibilities

Translate ambiguous customer needs into concrete technical tasks and drive them to completion

Represent WindBorne’s technical work to external partners, providing clarity, accountability, and credibility

Act as the connective tissue between our research team and customer-facing programs, ensuring our science delivers real-world impact

Skills and Qualifications
Strong foundation in machine learning and deep learning (PyTorch preferred), with experience training and debugging models end-to-end

Ability to write high-quality, maintainable code for ML workflows (data processing, modeling, evaluation)

Exceptional communication skills—you can clearly explain complex technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders

Self-directed learner who thrives in ambiguous, high-stakes environments

Interest in, or experience with, customer-facing work such as technical project management, research collaborations, or applied consulting

Strong work ethic and drive for constant improvement, balanced with the ability to collaborate within a high-functioning team

This role is for you if…
You are an ML engineer who doesn’t just want to code in a silo—you want to see your work make an immediate impact in the world

You thrive on both technical depth and human connection: you enjoy debugging CUDA, but you also don’t shy away from getting on a call with a DARPA program manager

You are excited to grow from a strong individual contributor into the technical owner of critical external programs
